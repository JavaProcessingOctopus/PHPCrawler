# PHPCrawler
This PHP project is made as part of a job interview.
I am new to PHP and this project is used to check if I am able to grasp it fast.

The task is to crawl a webpage and to display the 3 most used words.
First using PHP without framework and then with the symfony framework.
Both will be in a separate branch.
