# PHPCrawler
This PHP project is made as part of a job interview.
I am new to PHP and this project is used to check if I am able to grasp it fast.

The task is to crawl a webpage and to display the 3 most used words.
First using PHP without framework and then with the symfony framework.
Both will be in a separate branch.

To reach the result of the top 10 words you have to call the getTopController at "your_server_adress/getTop"

## Food for Thought
This exercice is a good way to see the zipf law in action and the word frequency in a language. Mor info here:
